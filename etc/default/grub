# Uncomment to enable os-prober. If there are other operating systems
# installed, os-prober can be run to generate their boot entries.
# However, if those operating systems use either LVM, encrypted
# volumes, or raw disks, running os-prober can be problematic
# since it attempts to mount their filesystems for probing.
